Polyply is a software suite/library that consists of three separate programs
- `polyply gen_params` for parameter file generation,
- `polyply gen_coords` for coordinate file generation
- `polyply gen_seq` which is an auxiliary program for generation sequences that can be read by the parameter generation program.
